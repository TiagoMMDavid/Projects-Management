# Projects Management (DAW project)

## Overview
Projects Management is a system divided into two components, a server application (developed using [Spring](https://spring.io/)) and a web application (developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/)). The system has the purpose of managing project issues and associated information.

Each project can hold the information of its name, description and the issues associated with it. The issues are characterized by having a state, a set of labels and comments which are posted by users.
